We talked about how one day we would use the connections and skills we get from this job to assemble the perfect team: the tech support, the brawn, and of course us, the brains. \\n\\nThen, of course, my family died and I moved to Boston. It had been too painful. I had not kept up with any of my connections, and dove myself into work. Day in, day out.

Did you forget that we\\'re smuggling sponges?\" That\\'s what the United States government was calling them. It had only been 20 years earlier, that the vote was passed with a 3% majority voting yes. Everybody over the age of 65 was deemed a sponge, and was  to be executed with haste to conserve resources there were plenty of. The following months had been horrific. All sponges were put in buses with SWAT members, and brought to gas chambers across the nation. Several were put up in every state. Still, many had managed to stay hidden, and many had the need to disappear. Most that we transported were in their late 50\\'s and early 60\\'s, so  that they could get out before the government started monitoring them. The oldest we had ever seen was an 88 year old man.\\n\\n\"I guess, but you know how irritable they can get sometimes. I just don\\'t want any of them starting an argument, because you KNOW that we can never win those.\" I whispered in his ear and ended with a chuckle.

And what sort of fantastic monsters are you children supposed to be?”\\nShe was met with only silence and fearful gazes. “Well?”, she inquired gently. One of the creatures shuffled forwards, its several stalked eyes swiveling to take in her looming form and the bright festive lights that draped her doorway. “What’s your name?”, she asked it.\\n\\nThe creature emitted a chirp from one of the orifices on its body that most resembled a mouth. Unsure how to proceed, she eventually grabbed a Snickers bar from a bowl to her side and offered it in an outstretched hand. Without hesitation, a tentacle swiped the treat from her palm, leaving behind a viscous slime. “Oh! Uh…”, she began, startled, but they had already beaten a hasty retreat, scuttling down her driveway and into the darkness, presumably onto another house.\\n\\nThis went on for most of the night, approaching houses and collecting candy, and it almost did so without a hitch, with the exception of a close encounter with a now traumatised chihuahua. When the hour had grown late, and the wandering children more scarce, they returned once more to the meadow.\\n\\nThe ship’s door slid open again, and the creatures piled in, chirping and clicking in excitement that they could no longer contain. One by one, they regurgitated they individual hauls into a pile in the middle of the floor. The candy sat there, still in their various wrappers, but now covered in a translucent mucus. The alien din reached a climax as their eyes darted back and forth eagerly across their prize. Before their annual feeding frenzy could begin, however, they were interrupted by a foreign sound. A gentle sobbing.\\n\\nThe creatures parted quickly to reveal a small child who had become lost and followed the wrong group home. Lost and afraid, he whimpered softly as he gazed around at the assortment of knobs, buttons and flashing lights that lined the interior of the ship. After a brief shocked silence, the aliens burst into a panic and clambered for cover, having found themselves in an unprecedented predicament. The boy’s sobs grew into wails amidst the confusion and flurry of movement.\\n', ' They just wanted to die a bit less.\\n\\nMost of these times, the retired heroes fancied the sunnier places, which was just as fine as I didn\\'t want the rowdy likes of Vale or Jade in my tavern anyway.  No, I ran a cleaner business, and the retired heroes who needed it used it often.  There was a corner, you see, one they liked well.  No one ever seemed to sit there but them.  My customers know when to leave a place like that alone and the retired heroes know when a space is meant for them.\\n\\nSir Tulsar was one of my most common patrons.  He\\'d come in, buy a drink, an expensive whiskey that I keep just for him and never let run dry.  Often he\\'d meet someone there. A wraith, well disguised in human clothes but hovering just enough off the ground that the trained eye could spot him.  Or once he met the company of two shade witches.  Unsavory folk like that could be bad for business, but as long as Tulsar bought them top-shelf drinks, my coffers never suffered.\\n\\nThe Master Enchanter of the castle often came to study.  He kept his nose down, aware of the attitudes towards experimental magic.\\n\\n\"Not here to blow up the place, eh?\" I\\'d always ask, when he entered.\\n\\nHis face would contort, the same irate, ashamed look, and he\\'d tip well on the brandy he bought.  That was our only exchange, every time he came by, but if it bothered him, it didn\\'t show in his patronage.\\n\\nI never noticed when Master Feng came in, try as I might.  I\\'d be looking down, washing a glass, serving another customer, or stretching my old bones, and when I checked back at the bar, she\\'d be there, dressed all in black, smiling, and smelling of horses.  It was a game to her, sneaking up on me, one I never claimed a victory in.\\n\\n\"Thank you!\" she\\'d say, upon taking her ale and disappearing off to the corner.  She was the only one who ever thanked me.  Sometimes she\\'d appear at the bar again and others she\\'d disappear without a trace.  I often theorize that she hides in here sometimes, after closing.  I can\\'t otherwise rationalize how she leaves without me seeing.\\n\\nThe first time Falern entered the']\n"

The next may not be, and it was that hope and joy both human and their soul held tightly. \\n\\nI stared at the spirit with both awe and confusion.

It is decided.\" \\n\\nWith a swish of my hand, I erased the blue words. I\\'ve never erased a soul\\'s last words before; their first last words or thoughts were meaningful through every incarnation, and erasing them was similar to erasing a piece of their existence. \\n\\nBut it had to be done.

The vibrations it affected in space, and the undulations in time, is caused. So snuff out a little bit of the spark. I remembered everything there is, everything there was, and everything there will be about rat posion. And the moment she closed her mouth, I changed it into sugar. \\n\\nPadma choked. She spat it out, reflexively. Into his face. He took a finger, still sinking in quick sand. But ever. So. Slow. If he went slow enough, maybe he would die. I'd have taken that. A joy in watching even this idiot die. But he wasn't shittin' slow enough. She was only supposed to spit it out in two dimensions. And there was gonna be almost no glorious consequences for her. No water into wine. No impervious to cuts and bruises except on a heel. No magically reinforced bones. No being able to move mountains. No regrowing organs. No walking on water. If he was slow, he died, she lived, and the whole event would be so inconsequential. It would work without him. I knew all about him in that moment. Just like the rat poison. But the cards never got dealt in my favor anymore. In two stupid realities, she spat it out. And I knew in almost every timeline, he wasn't slow enough. He took his finger, wiped the goopy, spitty, sugar, and ate it. Swallowed. How I wish I could just turn it back into rat poison. But since Padma was born, I couldn't alter reality to hurt others. I could only alter her reality. And I saw everytime, when I let her die, or helped her die, or forced her to die, it went blank. Then we went back to the moment she died and I changed it so she didn't. I remembered the blankness. I died too. We caught on pretty quick. It took me a whole Yuga, to catch on. Or so it seemed. She was 1 then. It only took her till age 4 to understand it too. But by four, I managed to pack in a lifetime of hurt and misery. It made her timid, but it also made her frightfully smart.

After 6 days of unsuccessful search the people and the leaders of the world had given up. They weren't able to complete the noble task. All hope was lost. \\n\\nThat was until a simple south American shepherd noticed something suspicious on his way home. \\n\\nHe immediately reported this to the officials and 5000 men with tanks, choppers and artillery support surrounded the cottage where Mr. Snuggles was hold hostage. After negotiations broke down a simple soldier managed to sneak behind the terrorist and knock him out. \\n\\nThe criminal had to be protected from the angry mob that assembled outside and the leaders of the world rushed to deliver the teddy to the little girl.\\n\\nThe girl was pleased with the combined effort of the entire Earth and told her daddy not to use the planet as a test target for the Lyssan Empire's newest super weapon.\\n\\nThis day was a national holiday from then on. It was the day Earth stood together to save the planet and the shepherd got rid of his annoying neighbor who also shagged his wife. And also the day the Martians got royally fisted with a Planetcracker because they refused to search for a teddy.Writing Prompt: A little girl accidentally called the military about a mean guy who stole her teddy bear; Mr. Snuggles. This is how the world's largest military operation went down.Response: “WE CAME HERE FOR WHAT!?”\\n\\nOne of the soldiers shouted while slamming their fist into\\nthe wall.

Writing Prompt: When aliens land on Earth, it is quickly discovered that flies are actually the deadliest species in the cosmos. Species from Earth are just immune to them.Response: March 22nd. That was the big day. The day my girlfriend Serena was coming to visit me. It was a 2 day trip. I know that seems like a long time, but I mean hey, the Kuiper Belt is pretty far away compared to Earth and not everyone can afford the luxury seats. \\n\\nSerena and I met on an archeological dig on the moon Titan. We were assigned to work together and things just sort of clicked. We found it easy to talk with each other and found out that we had a surprisingly large amount of things in common. Example: We both found the ancient history of the Hirians of Titan fascinating. We also both really enjoyed dancing when no one was watching. I'll never forget the way the sun, for a fleeting moment, shone on her light-purple skin and how the rays ran through the spaces between her 4 fingers. \\n\\nAnyway, I'm rambling. She finally arrived on March 22nd and were to spend a month together. And what an amazing month it was. I introduced her to so many of Earth's trademarks. Various foods, wingsuit gliding, baseball games. And she showed me a few things as well like how she could glide on her own by manipulating magnetic waves in the air and catching a baseball with her hair. \\n\\nAt this point, one would wonder how safe she could've been as a non-Earthling on a planet teeming with flies, an insect species only beings from Earth are immune to. Her ability to manipulate magnetic waves helped to stave off the occasional fly and if that didn't work, she'd crack the whip of a strand of sparkling, yellow hair and strike out down. It was like watching an old western where the cowboys or outlaws tossed a quarter in the air and shot a perfect hole through it.\\n\\nOn the final night of her trip, we walked through a small\", 'Everyone thinks that you are me – and I you. Let’s take a moment and ponder.” Lucifer slipped his forefinger over his lips. “All of the bad stuff that’s been happening above could not have been me.

You are nothing but a traitor to your people. You will be damned here forever!”\\n\\nLucifer rolled his eyes before laughing, “You want to listen to a babysitter? I mean my God – Oh!” Lucifer paused while laughing hysterically. He covered his mouth with his hand before he remarked, “I forgot, God is also gone.”\\n\\n“Do not listen to him. He just wants to be free of his shackles.” The devil locked eyes onto Satan who remained quiet.\\n\\nSatan shook his head. “I have been here for Centuries.”\\n\\nLucifer smiled while shaking his chains in a mocking manner. The Devil replied before exiting the chamber, “This is why they chose you as the third guardian. This is why you will always be Hades.”\\n\\nAfter the Devil left, it was just Satan and Lucifer.\\n\\n“Oh Satan.” Lucifer smiled.\\n\\n“It’s Hades.” \\n\\nLucifer’s face scrunched up, “That’s not what they are calling you today.

Wow, I just thought he was supposed to be your partner but instead he leaves you in the dark – like me – ironic isn’t it.”\\n\\nSatan’s confusion was like a virus spreading in his head.

Suddenly the sand around us began to shake and quake, as large structures started to rise above the sand (it turns out the sand itself was being \"drained\" in some way).

His mother had left when he was a young boy, running off to Florida with a tan car salesman she met in a cooking class, leaving nothing more than a yellow post-it note that said she was sorry.  He had ever since been wary of depending on another human being, which in turn made those around him feel unwanted.  \\n\\nWhen he was a university student, he would sometimes hear the shouts and giggles of revelers outside his bedroom window or coming from down the dormitory hall.

Sometimes, his classmates would encourage him to attend parties hosted in one of the drafty, sheet metal houses near the campus, where groups of friends that had long ago found each other had made a home and memories together.  He would stand in their kitchen, with the bottle of beer getting warm in his palm, and hover like a poltergeist on the outskirts of conversations.
